Encoder-Decoder Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) is a type of neural network architecture used for machine translation, speech recognition, and other natural language processing tasks. The Encoder-Decoder Seq2Seq model is composed of two recurrent neural networks (RNNs): an encoder and a decoder.

The encoder RNN takes in a sequence of inputs, such as words or characters, and converts them into a fixed-length vector representation called the context vector. The context vector represents the meaning of the input sequence and is used to initialize the decoder RNN.

The decoder RNN takes in the context vector and generates a sequence of outputs, such as words or characters, that correspond to the desired output sequence. The decoder generates the output sequence one element at a time, using the context vector and the previous output element as input.

During training, the model is trained to minimize the difference between the predicted output sequence and the true output sequence. This is done by comparing the predicted output sequence to the true output sequence using a loss function such as cross-entropy.
